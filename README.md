# BayesianLearning
The primary goal of this project is to understand Bayesian Learning, its underlying principles, and its applications in machine learning and various real-world problems. Bayesian Learning is a statistical method that combines prior knowledge with observed data to make informed predictions and decisions while continuously updating beliefs as new data becomes available.

## Overview
Bayesian Learning is based on Bayes' theorem, which provides a probabilistic framework for updating the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. This method is widely applied in scenarios where uncertainty is prevalent, allowing for the updating of beliefs as new data comes in. The core elements of Bayesian Learning include prior beliefs, likelihood, and posterior probabilities.

**Key Elements:**

**Prior Beliefs:** Initial assumptions or knowledge before observing new data.
**Likelihood:** The probability of observing the data given the hypothesis.
**Posterior Probability:** Updated beliefs after observing the data, calculated using Bayes' theorem.
